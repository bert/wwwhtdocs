<h2>The gEDA Project partners with Linux Fund to boost gEDA/PCB usability</h2>
</center>

</a>
The gEDA Project is pleased to announce that it has partnered with
Linux Fund in a fundraising effort targeted to
expedite development of gEDA's flagship PCB layout program
<a href="http://pcb.gpleda.org/">"PCB"</a>. 
Within this partnership, expert gEDA/PCB developer DJ Delorie
has agreed to implement a set of enhancements designed to upgrade
PCB's usability and utility for electronics designers, making it an
attractive open source alternative to commercial PCB design tools.
With this project,
gEDA/PCB joins the VectorSection DWG interpreter project as part
of Linux Fund's growing open engineering and hardware initiative.
</p>

<p>
PCB is a twenty year old application. Originally written in 1990 for
the Atari ST, the program was ported to Unix in 1994. Over the years,
it has been maintained and extended by a series of developers who have
added improvements and new features, including the ability to export
Gerber RS-274x files, an autorouter, and a GTK port.
Mr Delorie is currently one of the
chief developers involved with PCB, having become involved with the
project in 2002.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.delorie.com/">DJ Delorie</a>
is well known within the open source community as the
author of djgpp, a popular port of the gcc compiler to DOS. He is also
a long time user of PCB, having used the program to design a
net-enabled alarm clock which won second place in Circuit Cellar
Magazine's "Microchip embedded control" design contest in 2007. His
commitment to work on PCB usability enhancements in conjunction with
funding from the Linux Fund represents a major step forward for the
gEDA Project, as well as a welcome boost to the open-hardware
movement.

<h4>gEDA/PCB upgrade work description:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Implement forward annotation using action scripts</li>
<li>GUI modernization</li>
<li>Enhance ability to create and edit arbitrary layer types</li>
<li>Develop a new Footprint Editor</li>
<li>Update Design Rule Checking</li>
</ul>

<h4>About the gEDA Project</h4>

<p>
The gEDA Project is a community of open-source developers working on
creating tools for electronic design released under the GNU Public
License. The project currently offers a mature suite of free software
applications for electronics design, including schematic capture,
attribute management, bill of materials (BOM) generation, netlisting
into over 20 netlist formats, analog and digital simulation, and
printed circuit board (PCB) layout.
</p>

<p>
Besides the core design tools, the gEDA Project has gathered a
community of other programmers who work on their own tools while
sharing the gEDA e-mail lists, administration, and community
support. This extended set of electronics design applications has
become known as the "gEDA Suite".

<h4>About Linux Fund</h4>

<p>
Linux Fund is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that provides
financial and supervisory support to the open source software
community. Linux Fund raises funds with its line of rewards credit
cards and direct donations, and has given over half a million dollars
to open source projects since its founding in 1999.
