<H2>The gEDA Project Code of Conduct v1.0</H2>

<p>
This document offers some guidance to ensure the gEDA (GPL Electronic Design Automation) Project participants can cooperate effectively in a positive and inspiring atmosphere, and to explain how together we can strengthen and support each other.
</p>

<p>
This Code of Conduct is shared by all contributors and users who engage with the gEDA team and its community services.
</p>

<p>
This Code of Conduct reflects the agreed standards of behavior for members of the gEDA community, in any forum, mailing list, wiki, web site, IRC channel, public meeting or private correspondence within the context of the gEDA team and its services. The community acts according to the standards written down in this Code of Conduct and will defend these standards for the benefit of the community. Leaders of any group, such as moderators of mailing lists, IRC channels, forums, etc., will exercise the right to suspend access to any person who persistently breaks our shared Code of Conduct.
</p>

<H3> Be respectful and considerate </H3>

<UL>
<LI> Disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior or personal attacks. Remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable is not a productive one. </LI>
</UL>

<H3> Be patient, generous, and humble </H3>

<UL>
<LI> If someone asks for help it is because they need it. Do politely suggest specific documentation or more appropriate venues where appropriate, but avoid aggressive or vague responses such as "RTFM". </LI>
<LI> Also be aware that the gEDA community consists of many very busy people, so making demands or volunteering other people's time is not reasonable. Please be humble when approaching and making requests of the gEDA community. </LI>
</UL>

<H3> Assume people mean well </H3>

<UL>
<LI> Remember that decisions are often a difficult choice between competing priorities. If you disagree, please do so politely. </LI>
<LI> If something seems outrageous, check that you did not misinterpret it. Ask for clarification, but do not assume the worst. </LI>
</UL>

<H3> Try to be concise </H3>

<UL>
<LI> Avoid repeating what has been said already. Making a conversation larger makes it difficult to follow, and people often feel personally attacked if they receive multiple messages telling them the same thing. </LI>
<LI> Please read the appropriate archives to see what has been discussed in the past before starting a new discussion. </LI>
</UL>

<H3> Always communicate professionally </H3>

<UL>
<LI> Content that is racist, sexist, illegal (especially encouraging copyright infringement), pornographic, or containing offensive language (i.e. swearing, obscenities, or other adult language) is not allowed in any gEDA communication channel. </LI> 
<LI> Also, since many members of the gEDA community are professional engineers, please do not discuss any patents (current or expired) in any public gEDA communication channel. </LI>
<LI> Some gEDA communication channels have additional restrictions, such as no HTML or attachments. Please follow these rules. </LI>
</UL>

<p> 
This document (gEDA Code of Conduct) is derived heavily from the GNOME and KDE Code of Conduct documents. Many thanks to these organizations for their generosity.
