Bug/Todo List
1997 Dec. 27


Bugs:

	a.  $monitor does not produce output for all changes to the arguments.

	b.  Error reporting on the preprocessor output will not correctly
	display the filename and line number.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


This is a list of features that are lacking in the current implementation
of the Verilog Behavioral Simulator.  This list is sorted according to
priority.

1.	There doesn't seem to be a portable way of detecting a premature
	EOF using yacc.  The current method works for Linux, but not BSDI.
	Need to find a new way to fix this problem.

	The inheritance tree for module items and tf declarations are not
	clean.  We should use a pure virtual class to specify the interface.
	Currently, GCC front end for C++ is not very ANSI conformant so this
	would be hard to achieve at the moment.  The class hierarchy of the
	symbol table node objects is also out of control.  A new method is
	needed to handle actions on these objects.

2.  Add more constructs:

	Here's a list that's been requested:
		initializer for wire declaration
		ident.ident
		multiple concatenation
		$dumpvar, prerequestsite:  ident.ident
		instantiation by name

3.  Add logfile support.
	Decide what should be logged and where in the code to log it.
	Including sanity checks in all objects seems too paranoid.  But
	if we are to support a logfile, this is basically what we need
	to do.  The best way to do this is to start at the highest
	level in the object hierarchy.
	(Sanity check: have the object tell us what it is doing.)

4.  Wave viewer.  This was suggested by an interested user.  Since
	I know nothing about such viewers, it will be a while before
	one is available.  Support for a wave viewer can be added, though.
	The dumpvar* system tasks will be supported in a future release.

5.  PLI support.  Since I am mostly interested in synthesizable constructs,
	I don't know how plausible this support would be.

7.  Update docs:

   0123 4567 8911 1111 1111 2222 2222 2233
               01 2345 6789 0123 4567 8901

   0000_0000_0000_0000_0000_0000_0000_0000

	0     flag
	1-7   object type (group)
	8-15  sub-type
	16-19 object information
	20-31 object type
	

	expr = 0x01
	dec  = 0x02
	misc = 0x03
	decl = 0x04
	module item = 0x05
	module instance = 0x06
	lvalue = 0x07
	case item = 0x08
	stmt = 0x09

8.  Code clean up:

		When RTTI is supported, remove the use of get_* member functions to
		retrieve the derived class when only the base class is available.

		Remove templates from common objects, event queue, time wheel,
		symbol table.  Use a base class to reference the actual object
		'T'.  Removing templates reduces compile time.  The problem is,
		how do we define the base class?

		Change all access to symbol table node types to be pointers
		to the base class.  This requires an assignment member function
		in st_node_base.

These are only a few suggestions for enhancement.  It will take some time
to add all these features.  We might also have missed other Verilog
constructs that are important.  If so, they should have higher priority.
